# Discord5050
A python program that recursively searches randomly generated discord media links for random images uploaded to discords servers

Use multiple windows (a macro to open them would be helpful) on a high-core CPU, suggested 16 or more to yield results in any realistic timeframe

I am not responsible for any images found or the harm that is caused by them. Discord is responsible by making all images uploaded as publicly viewable and not accurately describing that fact to its users in an easily accessible location.

I have only exploited their flaw, which they let me exploit by having one.
