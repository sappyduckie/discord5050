# Discord5050
A python program that recursively searches randomly generated discord media links for random images uploaded to discords servers.

Use multiple windows (a macro to open them would be helpful) on a high-core CPU, suggested 16 or more to yield results in any realistic timeframe.

This exclusively searches for images named img.png because I didn't want the headache of figuring out a relatively small image name generator. You can add SPOILER_ to the name to exclusively search for spoilered images if you want a higher ratio of NSFW.

I am not responsible for any images found or the harm that is caused by them. There can and will be NSFW. Discord is responsible by making all images uploaded as publicly viewable and not accurately describing that fact to its users in an easily accessible location.

I have only exploited their flaw, which they let me exploit by having one.
