# discord5050
A Discord bot that finds and validates randomly generated Discord media links. Submissions accepted.

## Due to the sensitivity of this project, I will NOT be publishing the search algorithm, rather the bot itself that returns an image stored from the algorithm.
- Image submissions will be accepted within the bot under /submit (attached image)
- User submitted images can be viewed via /user
- Generated images can be viewed via /gen
- Images will not be generated per user due to the intensity of the search tree, they will be uploaded to the .sqlite file every time one is found (I cannot provide an ETA at this time)
